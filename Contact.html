<p style="color:white;">Hello, my name is Erik Swenson. I've created this site to have easy access to alot of things that I work on
	Personal email:		sagethedawg@gmail.com
	Professional email:	erikswenson@students.columbiabasin.edu
	Phone number:		Contact my email if you need my number
	
	
	On this website you will find a variety of things. The most impostant thing you will find is a link to my Github repositories.s 
	In the repositories, you will find a large amount of saved code that I've worked on over the years.
	The next thing you will find that is important is a link to my new page(probably not there yet)
	Other than that, the rest that you will see is essentially just personal projects that I decided to share.</p>
